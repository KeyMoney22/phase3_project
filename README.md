# Phase 3 Project Description

## Business Problem
The goal of this analysis and model determine with water pumps are faulty and hence enable access to clean water accross Tanzania reliably. 

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to use classification modeling tecniques to accurately predict which water pumps are faulty and allow for stakeholders to repair/replace such and ensure consistent supply of clean water accross Tanzania.

## Modeling
The modeling process involves preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. We then split the data into training and testing sets and build a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices. The model utilizes various features to make predictions and is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared to assess its performance.

## Regression Results
The final model achieved an adjusted R-squared score of approximately 0.67. These scores indicate decent predictive performance, suggesting that the model captures a significant portion of the variance in house prices. 

The model's coefficients provide insights into the relative importance of different features in determining house prices, which can be valuable for stakeholders in the real estate industry.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project demonstrates the utility of multiple linear regression in predicting house prices based on various features. By leveraging data-driven insights, stakeholders can make more informed decisions regarding buying, selling, or investing in real estate. Moving forward, further refinements to the model and additional data sources could enhance its predictive accuracy and provide even more valuable insights for stakeholders in the housing market.
