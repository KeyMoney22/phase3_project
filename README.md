# Phase 3 Project Description

## Business Problem
The goal of this analysis and model determine with water pumps are faulty and hence enable access to clean water accross Tanzania reliably. 

## Objective
The purpose of this analysis is to use classification modeling tecniques to accurately predict which water pumps are faulty and allow for stakeholders to repair/replace such and ensure consistent supply of clean water accross Tanzania.

## Modeling
The modeling process involves preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. We then split the data into training and testing sets and build a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices. The model utilizes various features to make predictions and is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared to assess its performance.

## Modeling Results
Overall, The best perfoming classsication model is the Gradient Boosting Model with an accurancy of 80%. 
Further, the random forest model performed well with an accuracy of 78%


## Conclusion
Overall, this project demonstrates the utility of classification models in improving the predictive power of data. Classification models have allowed us to corretly predict by upto 80% if a water pump needs to be repaired.
